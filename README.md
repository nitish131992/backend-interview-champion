This documents compiles all the knowlede I have accumalted over last 7 years in my experience. I still believe there is lot to be done.
This is my attemt to explain in a simple and easy way. There are thing which even I do not undestand fully.
Sole pupose here is to share what I know and in the process learn from you what I do not know.

There is a popular saying 

> _" Sukh baatne se badhta hai, dukh baatne se kam hota hai " (happiness increases & sadness reduces on sharing with others)_

As a Software Engineer , what I believe

> _" knowledge baatne se badhta hai, doubts baatne se kam hota hai " (knowledge increases & doubts reduces on sharing with others)_ 

Please feel free to point or any mistake you find out or any feedback you have for me. We can work together. Raise a PR or reach
