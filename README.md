# Be a 10x Enginner

This documents compiles all the knowlede I have accumalted over last 7 years in my experience. I still believe there is lot to be done.
This is my attemt to explain in a simple and easy way. There are thing which even I do not undestand fully.
Sole pupose here is to share what I know and in the process learn from you what I do not know.

There is a popular saying 

> _" khushi baatne se badhti hai, dukh baatne se kam hote hai " (happiness increases & sadness reduces on sharing with others)_

As a Software Engineer , what I believe

> _" knowledge baatne se badhti hai, doubts baatne se kam hote hai " (knowledge increases & doubts reduces on sharing with others)_ 

Please feel free to point or any mistake you find out or any feedback you have for me. We can work together. Raise a PR or reach

## Programming Language
Choosing a programming language and try to deep dive into it. Below are some of the programming langauga one can choose from
* Java
* Python
* C/C++
* C#

I'm an expert in Java and have understanding of python. If you have queries or doubt around it reach out to me.

Top 8 Programming Paradigms
üîπ Imperative Programming
Imperative programming describes a sequence of steps that change the program‚Äôs state. Languages like C, C++, Java, Python (to an extent), and many others support imperative programming styles. 

üîπ Declarative Programming
Declarative programming emphasizes expressing logic and functionalities without describing the control flow explicitly. Functional programming is a popular form of declarative programming. 

üîπ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods or functions). Common object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, Python, Ruby, and C#. 

üîπ Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) aims to modularize concerns that cut across multiple parts of a software system. AspectJ is one of the most well-known AOP frameworks that extends Java with AOP capabilities.

üîπ Functional Programming
Functional Programming (FP) treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and emphasizes the use of immutable data and declarative expressions. Languages like Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, and some features in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Scala support functional programming paradigms.

üîπ Reactive Programming
Reactive Programming deals with asynchronous data streams and the propagation of changes. Event-driven applications, and streaming data processing applications benefit from reactive programming.

üîπ Generic Programming
Generic Programming aims at creating reusable, flexible, and type-independent code by allowing algorithms and data structures to be written without specifying the types they will operate on. Generic programming is extensively used in libraries and frameworks to create data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and algorithms like sorting, searching.

üîπ Concurrent Programming
Concurrent Programming deals with the execution of multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, improving performance and resource utilization. Concurrent programming is utilized in various applications, including multi-threaded servers, parallel processing, concurrent web servers, and high-performance computing.



## Java
* Core Java
* Java 8 - 17

## DSA and Algorithm
1 Asymptotic Notations
1.1.1	Time Complexity
1.1.2	Space Complexity

## Low Level System Design Low(LLD)

### OOPs Concepts
* Class, object,  Abstract Class, Interface
* Pillars of OOPs
  *Abstraction
  *Encapsulation
  *Inheritance
  *Polymorphism

### Coupling / Cohesion

### SOLID Principles
Benefits
* Helps us to write better code.
* Avoid duplicate code.
* Easy to maintain.
* Easy to understand.
* Flexible Software
* Reduce complexity.

**S** -> Single Responsibility 
	The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This promotes code modularity and makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

**O** -> Open / Close
	The Open-Closed Principle emphasizes that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without altering its existing code

**L** ->  Liskov‚Äôs Substitution
The Liskov Substitution Principle emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that the behaviour of a subclass should not contradict the behaviour of its superclass.

**I**   -> Interface segregation
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn‚Äôt use. This promotes smaller, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

**D** -> Dependency Inversion
	The Dependency Inversion Principle advocates that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This promotes decoupling and flexibility in your code.

Or 

class should depend on interface rather than concrete class.

### Other Principles
* DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
* Encapsulate What Changes
* Favor Composition over Inheritance
* Programming for Interface not implementation
* Delegation principles

How does Docker work?

The diagram below shows the architecture of Docker and how it works when we run ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù, ‚Äúdocker pull‚Äù and ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù.

There are 3 components in Docker architecture:

üîπ Docker client
The docker client talks to the Docker daemon.

üîπ Docker host
The Docker daemon listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

üîπ Docker registry
A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use.

Let‚Äôs take the ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù command as an example.
1. Docker pulls the image from the registry.
2. Docker creates a new container.
3. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container.
4. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network.
5. Docker starts the container.
